      <h3>Hi, my name is Cameron Weiss, and I am a current freshman at CSULB. I am currently working on my computer science degree, a field I have had passion in for a few years now. As a freshman in high school, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. After taking a tour of Blizzard Studios. I was able to get an inside look into game protgramming, and the tech culture in general. I quickly fell in love with the idea of programming, and the creativity that came with it. I soon began teaching myself how to code, and making my own games with the newly found knowledge. Recently, I have dove into Machine Learning and even made my own self driving car (link to youtube in the header, where you can watch the (unfinished) series).</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>I also play lacrosse. I currently play semi-pro box lacrosse for Legion LC, and occassionally coach a youth team. I started playing in middle school, and enjoyed the sport. In my junior year I led my team in goals, and was named offensive MVP. Unfortunately, my senior year was cut short due to the covid pandemic. I am also part of the lacrosse team at CSULB. Feel free to click the links in the header to explore my media.</h3>
